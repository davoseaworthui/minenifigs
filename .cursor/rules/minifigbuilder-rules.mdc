description: Rules for clean and scalable code generation

---
- Carefully analyze the requirements I have attached in the docs
- Be descriptive in identifying the MVPs based off the prompt and docs
- Use meaningful and relateable naming conventions
- Functions should be refactored when it becomes to abstract, maybe allow 30-40 lines maximum.
- Recheck generated code to ensure it aligns with the original intent.
- Do not hardcode secrets. Use environment variables and .env files.
- Leave TODO comments when improvements or refactors are needed.
- Follow strict typescript rules based on the response of the API and with that the requirements entail
- Prefer well-maintained, stable libraries and justify their use.
- Run a diagnostic when new components, libraries are introduced.
